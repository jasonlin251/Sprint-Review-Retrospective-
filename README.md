## Reflections  

### 1. How do you interpret user needs and implement them into a program?  
I start by looking at user stories, since they explain what the user wants and why it matters. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, the story *“As a traveler, I want to search for trips by destination so I can compare options”* gave us a clear and simple feature to build:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. By focusing on small stories with acceptance criteria, we turned user needs into working features that could be tested and shown to stakeholders. This made sure we built what the users really needed instead of guessing.  

### 2. How do you approach developing programs, and what Agile processes will you continue to use?  
When developing programs, I prefer building them step by step with frequent feedback instead of waiting until the end. Agile helped me do this by breaking work into sprints and always aiming to deliver a small, working piece of software. I want to continue using daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and backlog refinement because they kept the team focused and organized:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. These processes gave us flexibility and made it easier to handle changes, which is something I plan to carry forward in future projects.  

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a good team member means communicating openly, giving honest updates, and helping others when they are stuck. In this project, daily stand-ups and sprint reviews made it clear that teamwork and communication were just as important as coding:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. A strong team is not just about technical skills but about trust and collaboration. By working together and supporting each other, the team can deliver better results than working alone.
